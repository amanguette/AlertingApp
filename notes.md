# project notes

## notes
- difference between interceptor and middleware: both are here to intercept a request, but interceptors can log a bit more things, and allow us to get info both on request and response ; middlewares seems to allow it only on request.

## todo
- split route for add/update tickets into two different ones
- add an interceptor to log something
- add a logger 
- optional feature: add comments on tickets
